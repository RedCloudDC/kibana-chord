This directory is for building a custom D3 bundle for inclusion in the plugin .zip file.

This is a lightweight alternative to including the complete `node_modules` directory, which would includes hundreds of unnecessary files and bloat the .zip.

Usage based on [Mike Bostockâ€™s Block - D3 Custom Bundle II](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/97557a39b4bfc8229786c8bccb54074d)
